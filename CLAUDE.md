# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**Feltwork is shelved.** It was an earlier design system, rolled out to four sites in August 2026 and then reverted everywhere. Nothing consumes it. `README.md` records what it is and how it would be picked back up.

Do not confuse it with **Felt**, the identity of `@doshi-experiments/design-system` since release 0.6.0. Shared UI work belongs in that repository, not here.

## Never publish PII or sensitive information

Nothing personal or sensitive goes to GitHub, under any circumstances, without Rishabh's direct approval of that specific content. That covers files, commit messages, branch names, pull requests, issues, comments, release notes, screenshots and test fixtures, and it applies even while a repository is private: every repository on this account is public or will be.

- Personal data: names other than Rishabh's public name (household members, pets, friends), email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, the city or neighbourhood the household lives in, dates of birth, health or care providers.
- Financial data: account or card numbers, balances, real transactions, statements, payees and merchant strings, amounts and dates from real data, which banks or cards are held, anything from bank exports or Actual Budget.
- Secrets and infrastructure: `.env` contents, API keys, tokens, passwords, private hostnames and IP addresses, Tailscale names, Home Assistant entity names and user ids, chat ids.
- Anything copied from a real export, inbox, database or log. A file named "example" or "sample" must be invented, not trimmed from real data.

Commit identity: author and commit only as `doshi-experiments <311927837+doshi-experiments@users.noreply.github.com>`. Run `git config user.email` before the first commit in any checkout, and never put a personal address in a `Co-authored-by` trailer.

Commit messages and pull request text are as public as the code. Describe what changed and why, not the real data that prompted it: no real merchants, amounts, transaction dates, account names or people, even as examples.

Use synthetic fixtures instead. Before every commit and push, check the staged diff, any new untracked files and the message itself for this kind of content. If something looks sensitive, or you are unsure, stop and ask; do not commit it, push it or open a pull request with it. Earlier approval of a different change does not cover this one. Git history is permanent: a leak can only be removed by rewriting history and recreating the repository.
